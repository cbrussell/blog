Grant Cardone:
>"Most people never go far enough in getting recognized, gaining attention, and making a big splash; they are trying to protect a reputation, a position, or some already achieved state. The successful are willing to take gambles – to put it all out there and know, regardless of the outcome, that they can go back and do it again. They allow themselves to be criticized, looked at, and seen by the world – while the unsuccessful hold back and play it safe."  



Seth Godin:
>You can’t be remarkable unless you stick out.”  

Don’t wait to share. Dont wait to be yourself. Don’t play it safe.  
  
Share now and share profusely.  

Stick out

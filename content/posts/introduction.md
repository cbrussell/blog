## Why a blog?

I've come a long ways in my 28 years as a student and professional. I think by now I might have a few ideas of my own to share and offer perspective from my journey.  

As of today, I work for SpaceX on the Dragon Supply Chain Team as a Buyer for mechanisms and mechanical assemblies. Prior to this, I was a Buyer at Volvo Cars USA, as awell as a Buyer and Engineer for TRU Simulation. Making my way to California has taken some time, but I finally feel I am working in a place that challeneges me and offers significant opportunity for growth. THe level of talent I interact with on a daily basis never ceases to amaze me. 

In my spare time, I like to read, produce electronic music, and workout. 

Today - I'm back in my hometown of Bedford, New Hampshire on Christmas Holiday. I've found some time to build this blog and set up a space where I will document whats on my mind and share my ideas.

Looking forward, I'd love to build content here and eventually begin sharing my work on medium. Following the success of this, I'd like to offer a subscription service on substack. 

I've never really seen myself as an author or talented in motivation, but I think starting is the best way to build a skill. Wish me luck.

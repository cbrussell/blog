## Why a blog?

At 28, it feels like I've come a long way, but I know this is only just the beginning. As I write, I hope to capture my ideas and my current mindset, maybe even provide some guidance to those who need it.

As of today, I work for SpaceX on the Dragon Supply Chain Team as a Buyer for mechanisms and mechanical assemblies. Prior to this, I was a Buyer at Volvo Cars USA, as awell as a Buyer and Mechanical Engineer for TRU Simulation. Making my way to California has taken some time, but I finally feel I am working in a place that challeneges me and offers significant opportunity for growth. THe level of talent I interact with on a daily basis never ceases to amaze me. 

In my spare time, I like to read, produce electronic music, and workout. 

I've never really seen myself as an author or talented in motivation, but I think starting is the best way to build a skill. Wish me luck.

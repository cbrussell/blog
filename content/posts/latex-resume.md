Iâ€™ve received a few job offers in my life and even more rejection letters. One thing that has always followed me along the way is my resume. The resume is a standard requirement during most application processes because it sums you up into one easy to digest page. For this reason alone, you must do everything you can to make it easy to read and effectively communicate the right information about who you are.  

Nearing my senior year at Clemson, I stumbled upon [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) - a free, high quality typesetting distribution. Frustrated with formatting shortcomings of Microsoft Word, I needed a software that could let me space, align, justify, and format my paper life exactly how I imagined it in my head. Using [Dan McGee's](https://www.toofishes.net/blog/why-i-do-my-resume-latex/) template, I was able to learn some Tex markup language and make my own variant suited to my strengths (which at the time was my leadership and internship experiences).

Every day, recruiters, managers, and employees at all levels look at resumes when evaluating potential candidates. For many companies, this document will be the first impression they have of you. When I applied to SpaceX back in 2019, all I sent them was my application and my fancy LaTeX resume. Luckily, the recruiter liked what he saw and decided to give me a call. If you can overcome the slight learning curve and get this up and running in a few hours, it could have a major impact in your job placement prospects. 

Here are a few reasons I continue to refine my resume in LaTeX and encourage you to do the same- 

### **Control and quality**  

A resume is a not just a piece of paper, it is a piece of art. In order to make great art, the best tools are required to deliver the highest quality and control in your efforts. If you take a look at some of the free LaTeX resume templates [available online](https://www.latextemplates.com/cat/curricula-vitae), you'll immediately notice how professional and academic they look.

### **Format once, then focus on content**

Once you have your code set, you can stop messing with the layout and focus on making awesome content about your life. If you see in my [free example template](/docs/free-resume-template.tex), there are tons of little adjustments I added in to fix the spacing to my taste, with a 0.1 em line space here and a parskip there. This is exactly the reason why so many academics prefer to use LaTeX - it allows for incredibly fine detail and adjustment. 

### **Stability**

Like your career, your resume will grow with you as you build experience and learn new skills. LaTeX is stable and remains mostly compatible, so you can update your resume as you progress and always have a copy ready for the right opportunity. Because it is written in plan text, you will be able to open this document 1 or 10 years from now and extract the same information from it. 

### **Other reasons**

Sometimes, the small things really make the difference. For example, the [computer modern font](/img/computer-modern.gif) is incredibly good-looking. Some would say this font alone is worth the effort of setting all of this up. Secondly, you can embed hyperlinks to navigate your viewers to your email, as seen in my example [header](/docs/free-resume-template.pdf). Thirdly, for the really nerdy, you can add a `/LaTeX` symbol to you skills section that some people might appreciate. 

  
  
Feel free to [download my example template here](/docs/free-resume-template.tex). If you're interested in my own skillset - shoot me a [mail](mailto:chris.russell02@gmail.com) and I'll send over my personal copy.

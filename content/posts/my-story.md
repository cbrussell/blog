Near graduating at Clemson University, my singular focus was to move to Charleston as quickly as possible and begin spending my new income on DJ equipment and bar tabs. If there was one goal in my life I’ve achieved to its fullest – consider it this. 

I was lucky to get a position as a Mechanical Engineer for a Defense Company in the area. Flash forward to three years later (it literally went by in a flash) and I was in the same exact position as I was when I graduated. I was broke - in debt actually, my career growth was flat, and my routine social life at the same bars was beginning to wear away at me. My emotional state was beginning to degrade. I became highly unproductive at work. I needed a change.  

Recognizing this – I began to apply to as many companies as possible, all over the US. Using some local networking, I locked down a Supply Chain role at an Automotive company in the area. Within 18 months, I began to feel some of the same emotional signals I felt at the first job. I was losing motivation, socially withdrawing, and becoming incredibly frustrated with my boss. Rinse and repeat and now I’m in Los Angeles with a highly respected Aerospace Company. 

Reflecting on my first two jobs – it wasn’t entirely the companies themselves to blame for my unhappiness. A lot of the reasons for my downward spirals related to my self-talk and workplace commitments. In both roles, I was stretched too thin, committed to too many projects, and locked in a paralysis of inaction. Thus began the negative feedback loop of poor performance, followed by negative thinking. So on and so fourth.

When you spend most of your life at work – you need to make sure to practice healthy habits that put your personal wellbeing ahead of your throughput. I'm going to talk about some of my daily habits in a future post, too!

Learning from my past mistakes, I’m focused now more than ever on bringing my fullest self to work every day, protecting my bandwidth, and speaking up if something needs to be said. Unless I’m super psyched to help out on a project, I don’t volunteer. If I know my bandwidth is nearing its limit, I say no to almost everything. I speak my mind unapologetically. Some key books have shaped the way I do my work and build relationships in the office. Specifically, Radical Candor, Drive, Making of a Manager, The Work of Leaders, and The Five Dysfunctions of a Team. 

I have found success on paper – but I am only at the very beginning of the next chapter of my life. Even today, making a blog at 28 years old, I catch myself saying “Chris, why have you waited so long to start sharing your ideas and writing?” I see this mindset everywhere. We think age restricts our capacity to try something new and fail. Hopefully through this experiment we call life, I'll finally see how much more failure is ahead of me.

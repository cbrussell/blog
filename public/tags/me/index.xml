      <description>Why a blog? I&amp;rsquo;ve come a long ways in my 28 years as a student and professional. I think by now I might have a few ideas of my own to share and offer perspective from my journey.
As of today, I work for SpaceX on the Dragon Supply Chain Team as a Buyer for mechanisms and mechanical assemblies. Prior to this, I was a Buyer at Volvo Cars USA, as awell as a Buyer and Engineer for TRU Simulation.</description>
